# MLOps-sample

A repository to showcase a basic **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** pipeline, integrating various tools and practices for model development, deployment, and monitoring.

---

## 🚀 Overview

 This project serves as a minimal working example (MWE) for a modern MLOps workflow. i will try create basic pipeline here as an example for future projects.
 
 
<!--It demonstrates best practices for:

* **Version Control** for code and configurations.
* **Data Versioning** (DVC, etc. - *mention what you use*).
* **Model Training** and artifact tracking (MLflow, etc. - *mention what you use*).
* **CI/CD** for automated testing and deployment.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed:

* **Python 3.x**
* **Git**
* **Docker** (Optional, if using containerization)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/ErfanDejband/MLOps-sample.git](https://github.com/ErfanDejband/MLOps-sample.git)
   cd MLOps-sample
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: The `requirements.txt` file should be in the root directory.*

## ⚙️ Usage

The primary workflow involves training a model, generating an artifact, and running a simple prediction service.

### 1. Training the Model

Run the main training script:

```bash
python src/train.py
``` -->
